# mascon
MasCon (formerly 'master_control') is a massive batch file I used to standardize local computer installations without the help of network shares or desktop software deployments.

I kept the script on USB drives with a folder structure of configurations, installers, group policies (LGPO), and whatever I else I could cram into a batch or powershell.

Some of the really useful stuff had to be removed or sterilized since it was proprietary.

The bulk of the commands have been commented so nothing will execute as is. You'll need to read the file and figure out what you need from it.

Good luck.
